The proposed framework enables to handle the case of destabilizing interconnections through state and/or control signals (which is the case of the cryogenic refrigerator example). Moreover, it offers the possibility to simply change the behavior of the overall system (depending on the context) by only changing the coordinator problem's parameters without changing the set of local controllers used by subsystems which is a common industrial requirement regarding industrial control architectures. Finally, the proposed scheme enables a smooth operator handover on a specific subsystem and/or actuator.","tags":null,"title":"Fixed-point based hierarchical MPC control design for a cryogenic refrigerator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mazen Alamir","Vuong V.

However, although this approach is appealingly simple and that it works astonishingly well in many practical situations, its use is rarely associated to an appropriate analysis of its convergence. In this paper, it is shown that this iteration can be rationally conducted using control theory in order to derive a provable stability under appropriate assumptions.","tags":null,"title":"On the stabilization of fixed-point iterations arising in hierarchical control design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vuong V.

This paper describes a anomaly detection method using support vector data description (SVDD) kernelized by Mahalanobis distance with adjusted discriminant threshold. The efficiency of this method is studied over a real data set. Numerical result demonstrates that the proposed approach achieved a high-level of detection accuracy and a low percentage of false alarm rate owing to wise choices of discriminant threshold.","tags":null,"title":"Anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks via support vector data description with Mahalanobis kernels and discriminative adjustment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vuong V.

The formulation of the identification problem takes, at each iteration, the form of a constrained linear (or quadratic) optimization problem that is mathematically feasible as well as numerically tractable. The efficiency of the proposed method for the derivation of low-complexity explicit model predictive controllers is demonstrated via the constrained control of a thermodynamic power plant.","tags":null,"title":"Explicit model predictive control via nonlinear piecewise approximations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vuong V.

Typically, OCSVM is kernelized by radial bais functions (RBF, or Gausian kernel) whereas selecting Gaussian kernel hyperparameter is based upon availability of anomalies, which is rarely applicable in practice. This article investigates the application of OCSVM to detect anomalies in WSNs with data-driven hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, the information of the farthest and the nearest neighbors of each sample is used to construct the objective cost instead of labeling based metrics such as geometric mean accuracy (G-mean) or area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). The efficiency of this method is illustrated over the IBRL dataset whereas the resulting estimated boundary as well as anomaly detection performance are comparable with existing methods.","tags":null,"title":"Data driven hyperparameter optimization of one-class support vector machines for anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Academic makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown.

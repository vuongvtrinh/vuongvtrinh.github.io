The proposed framework enables to handle the case of destabilizing interconnections through state and/or control signals (which is the case of the cryogenic refrigerator example). Moreover, it offers the possibility to simply change the behavior of the overall system (depending on the context) by only changing the coordinator problem's parameters without changing the set of local controllers used by subsystems which is a common industrial requirement regarding industrial control architectures. Finally, the proposed scheme enables a smooth operator handover on a specific subsystem and/or actuator.","tags":null,"title":"Fixed-point based hierarchical MPC control design for a cryogenic refrigerator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mazen Alamir","Van Vuong Trinh","Patrick Bonnay"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1502582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1502582400,"objectID":"5928adc3ddbeb0c62eb871c111d8069a","permalink":"https://vuongvtrinh.github.io/publication/2017-hdmpc-ifacwc/","publishdate":"2017-08-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-hdmpc-ifacwc/","section":"publication","summary":"Fixed-point iterations are commonly used to break the algebraic loops involved in the distributed optimization among computational entities sharing only a partial knowledge.

This paper describes a anomaly detection method using support vector data description (SVDD) kernelized by Mahalanobis distance with adjusted discriminant threshold. The efficiency of this method is studied over a real data set. Numerical result demonstrates that the proposed approach achieved a high-level of detection accuracy and a low percentage of false alarm rate owing to wise choices of discriminant threshold.","tags":null,"title":"Anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks via support vector data description with Mahalanobis kernels and discriminative adjustment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Van Vuong Trinh","Mazen Alamir","Patrick Bonnay","Francois Bonne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1476662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1476662400,"objectID":"84d71b8554bed36f69938dda73e4bcb5","permalink":"https://vuongvtrinh.github.io/publication/2016-enmpc-nolcos/","publishdate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-enmpc-nolcos/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a novel identification methodology is proposed to capture general multivariate nonlinear relationships, with focus on the bounded-error approximation of model predictive control for constrained (non)linear systems.

Typically, OCSVM is kernelized by radial bais functions (RBF, or Gausian kernel) whereas selecting Gaussian kernel hyperparameter is based upon availability of anomalies, which is rarely applicable in practice. This article investigates the application of OCSVM to detect anomalies in WSNs with data-driven hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, the information of the farthest and the nearest neighbors of each sample is used to construct the objective cost instead of labeling based metrics such as geometric mean accuracy (G-mean) or area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). The efficiency of this method is illustrated over the IBRL dataset whereas the resulting estimated boundary as well as anomaly detection performance are comparable with existing methods.","tags":null,"title":"Data driven hyperparameter optimization of one-class support vector machines for anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks","type":"publication"}]

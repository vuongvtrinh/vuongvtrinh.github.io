## Basic Trading Strategies

### Ping/Pong Order

Ping/pong submits multiple 'ping' orders; once a ping order fills, an associated 'pong' order is submitted.

Multiple ping/pong pairs can be created by specifying an order count greater than 1, a suitable min/max ping price, and a pong distance. Multiple ping orders will be created between the specified min/max prices, with the associated pongs offset by the pong distance from the ping price.

### Iceberg Order
Iceberg allows you to place a large order on the market while ensuring only a small part of it is ever filled at once. 

### TWAP Order

TWAP spreads an order out through time in order to fill at the time-weighted average price, calculated between the time the order is submitted to the final atomic order close.

The price can be specified as a fixed external target, such as the top bid/ask or last trade price, or as an explicit target which must be matched against the top bid/ask/last trade/etc.

### Accumulate/Distribute Order

Accumulate/Distribute allows you to break up a large order into smaller randomized chunks, submitted at regular or irregular intervals to minimise detection by other players in the market.

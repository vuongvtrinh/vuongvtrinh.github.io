## MICROSOL

### Challenges

You need to power a healthcare center, or infrastructure with continuous supply in an off-grid area. You want a sustainable and clean solar solution that produces more than electricity. Technological innovation makes access to energy a reality even in the most isolated zones.

### Value Proposition

- Production of heat, electricity and optionally purified water based on specific need
- Energy production at a consistent level 24 hours per day 
- Easy to use hybridization of Microsol with other energy sources: grid generator, photovoltaic, wind, etc.

### Differentiation

- Lifetime: at least 20 years 
- Innovative solar panels: parabolic-trough concentrating solar collector field 
- Fully customizable
- Pure water production and optional remote monitoring system

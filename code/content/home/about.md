# Background

I received engineer's degree from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2012, followed by master's degree from Université Joseph Fourier (UJF) and Institut Polytechnique de Grenoble (Grenoble INP) in 2014, both in automation and control engineering. I carried out process control and optimization research at Grenoble Images Parole Signal Automatique laboratoire (GIPSA-lab) and Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives (CEA) within Service des Basses Températures (INAC-SBT). I developed scientific software at Benjamin Muyl Design S.A. and serve as research scientist at Dong A University Research Institute.

My expertise includes control and automation as well as optimization and machine learning. I am also interested in quantitative, blockchain and cryptoasset analytics.

# About me

I received engineer's degree from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://en.hust.edu.vn/) in 2012, followed by master's degree from [Université Joseph Fourier (UJF)](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) and [Institut Polytechnique de Grenoble (Grenoble INP)](http://www.grenoble-inp.fr/) in 2014, both in automation and control engineering. I carried out process control and optimization research at [Grenoble Images Parole Signal Automatique laboratoire (GIPSA-lab)](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/) and [Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives (CEA)](http://www.cea.fr/) within [Service des Basses Températures (INAC-SBT)](http://inac.cea.fr/sbt/). I developed scientific software for sailing yachts at [Benjamin Muyl Design S.A.](https://www.bmuyl.com/) and served as research scientist at [Dong A University Research Institute](http://donga.edu.vn/).

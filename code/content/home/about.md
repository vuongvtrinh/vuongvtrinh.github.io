# About me

Hello! I am 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science Department at University of Southern California. Currently, I am a research assistant in [Data Science Lab](http://dslab.usc.edu) led by Professor [Viktor Prasanna](http://halcyon.usc.edu/~pk/prasannawebsite/index.php). My research focus is to explore new hardware architecture to accelerate deep learning models and apply deep learning algorithms to solve real world problems. Currently, I am working on [Deep Solar](http://deepsolar.usc.edu) project, in which we try to develop accurate predictive models of various distributed energy resources.

I have been invited to be a journal reviewer for [Integration, the VLSI Journal](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/integration-the-vlsi-journal/). I am glad to review paper on parallel computing, deep learning architecture and designs on FPGA.

Besides, I am also a passionate learner and willing to try new technologies. I am also enjoying teaching classes especially when sharing ideas with people.

      <description> This project develops an intelligent data driven application to monitor blockchain projects and to analyze cryptoassets from both utility and speculation perspectives. We target blockchain entrepreneurs, investors and traders all along the life of projects: token generation, listing on secondary market, product delivery, product usage, and token valorization.
Data-Driven Analytics Altcoin price versus supply analysis Market movement statistics Bitcoin aggregated statistics: traded exchanges vs. network transactions Newsflow sentiment analysis Advanced Trading Strategies Portfolio management and optimization Iceberg order and beyond Web Application Screenshots    </description>

      <description>As the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) grows, systems are increasingly being monitored by arrays of sensors returning time-series data at ever-increasing &amp;lsquo;volume, velocity and variety&amp;rsquo; (i.e. Industrial Big Data). Time Series is defined as a set of observations taken at a particular period of time. Time Series is also known as the stochastic process as it represents the vector of stochastic variables observed at regular interval of time. It appears naturally in many application areas such as economics, science, environment, medicine, etc.</description>
